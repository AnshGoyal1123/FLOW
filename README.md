Hello! Welcome to the SleepSync repository!

I'm Ansh Goyal, a freshman studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University.

This repository initially served as the repository for a startup named FLOW, created in August 2023 by a friend who's vision of "helping the world find its FLOW" really resonated with me. Since then, that friend has moved on, disbanding the startup, yet having ignited a curiosity about the wonders of signal processing in me.

To learn more about this intricate field, I continued on my work on the project, turning it into SleepSync, a way for me to explore this marvelous field at my own pace.

SleepSync is not meant to be a startup, a business of any kind, or a deliverable for a class. It is simply me playing around with concepts I honestly know little about, trying to see what I can learn. If you see this and have tips for me, please email me at agoyal19@jh.edu and I'd be happy to talk more!

Happy exploring!
